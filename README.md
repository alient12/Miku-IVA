# Miku-IVA
A new open source intelligent virtual assistant based on the popular Vocaloid Hatsune Miku

This is the start of a long-term open source project named Miku-IVA. I probably change the project's name because I have not thought about it and I just wanted to make
a repo to store my ideas.

## Main fetures:
- Using 3D character
- Using Miku voice
- Using reinforcment learning to make it more human like and smarter
- Using image processing to understand what users are doing and help them
- More practical commands e.g. "create a new C++ project in Visual Studio" or "download a few HD cyberpunk wallpapers"
- Using Github Copilot to help programmers e.g. "create a twitter message sender in python"

I'm currently working on the first part [(3D character)](https://github.com/alient12/MikuMikuAlive)
