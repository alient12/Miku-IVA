# Miku-IVA
A new open source intelligent virtual assistant based on the popular Vocaloid Hatsune Miku

This is the start of a long-term open source project named Miku-IVA. I probably change the project's name because I have not thought about it and I just wanted to make
a repo to store my ideas.

## Main fetures:
- Using [3D character](https://github.com/alient12/MikuMikuAlive)
- Using [Miku voice](https://github.com/vanstorm9/AI-Vocaloid-Kit-V2)
- Using reinforcment learning to make it more human like and smarter
- Using image processing to understand what users are doing and help them
- More practical commands e.g. "create a new C++ project in Visual Studio" or "download a few HD cyberpunk wallpapers"
- Using [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/) to help programmers e.g. "create a youtube downloader in python"
- Ability to [detect song](https://github.com/SeaDve/Mousai) from computer output sound even if it's muted
- Ability to detect [musical note](https://github.com/alient12/Musical-note-detector) and [songs note](https://github.com/vanstorm9/AI-Vocaloid-Kit-V2)

I'm currently working on the first part...
